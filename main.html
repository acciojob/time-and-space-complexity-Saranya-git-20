	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It helps us measure how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. For example, an algorithm that stores an input array of size n requires O(n) space.</p>
